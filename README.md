**Systems Engineering Final Degree Thesis Project: FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE FOR ESTIMATING SURGERY ROOMS’ USAGE TIME WITH DATA MINING TECHNIQUES**

** ----- Project Summary: ----- **
The primary objective of this thesis project is to develop a standalone prototype aimed at optimizing operating room administration by leveraging data mining techniques. The project will entail the collection and analysis of historical data on operating room utilization, followed by the development and training of a machine-learning model capable of forecasting the time required for various types of surgical operations. This approach will utilize a data-driven methodology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of operating room management.

** ----- Objectives: -----**
**GENERAL AIM:**
Develop a stand-alone prototype, using data mining techniques, for optimizing operating rooms’ management.

**SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES**
1. To characterize the allocation of operation rooms through an exploratory data analysis.
2. To design the components of a software solution that includes a data-driven decision-making model 
3. To produce the modules through the implementation of incremental built methodology.
4. To evaluate the prototype functionalities under controlled environments.

**Conclusion:**
To close this project, the knowledge generated and the results reached can be determined as satisfactory, as all the objectives were achieved, highlighting the proposed model and the understanding of the allocation problem and possible solutions and variations. 
The ORs usage is a common problem in health care, as there is not a globally validated solution, most hospitals opt for the First Come First Serve idea, but this is not optimal as some surgeries are more life-threatening than other kinds of emergencies, a different proposal is needed as all these variables need to be taken into account.
The general objective of this project was to create a prototype that was able to predict surgery time with acceptable accuracy. By leveraging algorithms and machine learning techniques, it delivers a valid range of time estimations that could greatly assist healthcare professionals in planning and organizing surgical procedures. 
Moreover, the system's ability to predict surgery time also contributes to the overall quality of care delivered to patients. With more accurate estimations, surgeons and medical teams can plan and prepare more effectively, ensuring that procedures are conducted with precision and attention to detail. This increased level of preparedness and coordination ultimately translates into improved patient safety and a higher standard of healthcare delivery.
